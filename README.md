# GlamUp â€“ Online Beauty Booking System

GlamUp is a web-based platform that connects customers with beauty service providers (artists).  
Customers can easily sign up, browse available services, and book appointments online.  
Artists can register, manage their bookings, and update appointment statuses through a dedicated dashboard.

This project was developed as part of CP3407 at James Cook University.
