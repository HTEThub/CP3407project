## ðŸ§ª Test Strategy

- âœ… Unit tested all PHP files containing core application logic
- âœ… Simulated `$_POST`, `$_GET`, `$_FILES`, and `$_SESSION` variables
- âœ… Validated security (password hashing, input escaping, session handling)
- âœ… Verified conditional logic paths, user roles, and form behaviors
- âœ… Avoided testing view rendering; focused on business logic

---

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **PHPUnit 12.1.2**
- **PHP 8.4.6**
- **macOS + XAMPP local server**
- Manual browser testing for UI behavior

---

## âœ… Testing Outcome

- âœ… **35 test cases written**
- âœ… **60 total assertions**
- âœ… **All tests passed successfully**
- âœ… Only minor warnings (no critical issues)
- âœ… No test failures or errors

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This test suite provides strong confidence in the logic and flow of the GlamUp project. Each major feature was tested in isolation, using realistic data and edge cases. Logic was validated through assertions, and security measures such as password hashing and session logic were also covered.
